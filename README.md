# Birkan Ak Assignment 2: MultipleScreens
This assignment is the second assignment (Multiple Screens) for CS-441. I used Android Studio and simulated this on the device 
Pixel 3a. My code has 2 views. The initial view increments your points by 1 with a button. The other view that can be accessed by another button is the gambling ground, where you get random points between -10 to +10 with a button click.

#### I hope you do not have a gambling addiction of any sorts and I hope this app does not create one.
